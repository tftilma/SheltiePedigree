  <ul>
    <li><b>Q: Can I see the pedigree of a Sheltie inside the pedigree?</b></li>
    <li>A: Yes, just click on any name and it's pedigree will pop up. This is a key feature of this program.
    More general: please do try to click on a lot of things, and find all hidden features. </li>
    <li><b> Q:What does "OL" and "OF" mean?</b></li>
    <li>A: It means "Other Line" and "Other Family". I use them only when I can reasonably be sure they
    don't fit in the well-known lines and families.</li>
    <li><b>Q: Some shelties have a photo and others have not.
    They show the typical picture of a missing picture.</b></li>
    <li>A: In those cases I haven't found a picture of those yet, and I don't have pictures for most Shelties.
    </li>
    <li><b>Q: Why do some shelties have no Line and/or Family?</b></li>
    <li>A: Sometimes I really don't know them. Sometimes I didn't have the time to fill them in yet.</li>
    <li><b>Q: What do the colours mean in the pedigrees?</b></li>
    <li>A: It means it is the same sheltie.</li>
    <li><b>Q: But sometimes I see the same sheltie, without a colour. Is this a bug?</b></li>
    <li>A: No. Then they have the same child. So, it is not necessary to put focus on them.
    Exceptions are only when this information cannot be deduced.</li>
    <li><b>Q: What do the magic numbers in the kennel overview mean ?</b></li>
    <li>A: It means the number of shelties I found with that kennel name.</li>
    <li><b>Q: Why are some kennels in bold, while others are not?</b></li>
    <li>A: Bold marked kennels contain at least 10 shelties.</li>
    <li><b>Q: Why are some shelties in a kennel overview in bold, while others are not?</b></li>
    <li>A: Bold marked shelties have an offspring size of at least 10 for dogs and 5 for bitches.</li>
    <li><b>Q: Can I jump from one champion to the next?</b></li>
    <li>A: Yes, click on "next ch". "prev ch" jumps to the previous one.</li>
    <li><b>Q: Sometimes I see (=name). What does that mean?</b></li>
    <li>A: It means the sheltie was previously known under a different name.
    The old name is between brackets.</li>
    <li><b>Q: Sometimes I see "(name)". What does that mean?</b></li>
    <li>A: The name is here one of the names of the owner. This is relevant for e.g. Fanny or Bob.
        But there's still some hard work to be done.
    </li>
    <li><b>Q: Sometimes I see "[name]". What does that mean?</b></li>
    <li>A: It means, I do not follow the official name [the one in square brackets like these].
    This information is based upon some reliable resources. The renamed ones are:
