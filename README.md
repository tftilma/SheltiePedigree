SheltiePedigree
===============

My (own) Sheltie Pedigree project written in Java generating all HTML from an XML, no database.

Since, there is no database at all, not for the end-user, but not even for me, it is super fast for end-users. 
For the huge number of shelties already present, over 14000, this might come to a surprise but I literally GENERATE 
each and every file. The idea is that once a Sheltie is born, all its data are known and fixed, and will never change 
right? So, why select all data from a database and all the hassle, and the waiting. 
All data can be found in the 5MB huge file xml/shelties.xml and from that file, I generate all files in the html directory

In eclipse, I run nl/home/ttilma/ped/Main.java
This will take a few minutes, and then voila you, get a like 17000 files in the html directory, that's all generated. 
Just upload these files each time (that will take a long time...)

You can get a copy using:
git clone git@github.com:tftilma/SheltiePedigree.git

Now, my program was build for the Shelties/Shetland Sheepdogs in mind, but of course, with some programming experience
probably lots of people can realize their own pedigree or anything similar. 



Regarding copyright and stuff:
If you like this program, great! Send me an e-mail at tilma6@zonnet.nl
You are permitted to copy my program, change it, make a fork of it on your own computer, send pull requests etc. 
But, I probably have made an error here and there (just like any other pedigree program for that matter). 
I don't take any responsibility for any error. I don't represent any official government body. 
And regarding the registrations: I only included some of that data for my own reference in the English Kennel Gazette. 
Close to all Shelties have a legal registration, but that wasn't that important then.
You should regard this as a hobby program of mine, a few years ago. And also with the tools I then had available.
